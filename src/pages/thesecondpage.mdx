import CanvasDraw from "react-canvas-draw";
import DrawImage from "../components/draw-image.js";

# so here is the second page

or as it is also known, the first mdx page!

## paint something:
<CanvasDraw/>


and next up we will make a submit button to save your drawing... then we will layer a drawing component over an image component so you can trace or annotate or highlight things within that image. then we will come up with other cool things to do!

## draw over this image:
<CanvasDraw
          brushColor="rgba(155,12,60,0.3)"
          imgSrc="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Wood_wall_2.jpg"
        />
